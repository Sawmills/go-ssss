# Conventional Commits Rule

All commit messages must be written in the **conventional commits** format.

## Format
A conventional commit message should follow this structure:

```
type(scope?): subject

body?  
footer?
```

- **type**: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- **scope**: (optional) The area of the codebase affected
- **subject**: A short description of the change
- **body**: (optional) A longer description
- **footer**: (optional) Any references to issues or breaking changes

### Example
```
feat(auth): add JWT authentication middleware

Implements JWT-based authentication for all protected routes.

BREAKING CHANGE: Old session-based authentication is removed.
```
